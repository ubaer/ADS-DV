# Summary
The visualisation will be about crime in Baltimore City, Maryland USA, the dataset is provided by the Baltimore Police Department and is updated monthly.<br>
The most interesting data is the combination of dates, times, locations (in the Lat/Lon format), and the type of crime. Visualising this on a map with some sort of time line can give us more insight on the issue.
